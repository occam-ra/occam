### OCCAM: Reconstructability Analysis Tools
Copyright (c) 1990 The Portland State University OCCAM Project Team

OCCAM is a collection of software tools comprising a library
with both command-line and web interfaces for
*Reconstructability Analysis* (RA), a kind of statistical
analysis closely related to Factor Analysis and Bayesian
Belief Networks.

The OCCAM project has been developed over several decades at
Portland State University under the auspices of its creator
Prof. Martin Zwick. Programmers contributing to the work
have included Ken Willett, Joe Fusion and H. Forrest
Alexander.

This software is currently being released for the first time
as Free Software under the GPL v3 or later. Please see the
file `LICENSE` in this distribution for license terms.

As of right now, the software will be a bit challenging to
get started with. There is documentation included, but it is
rather out-of-date. The core functionality is encapsulated
in a fairly standard C++ library whose interface should be
relatively understandable to anyone familiar with both C++
and RA. Help making this software more generally and broadly
usable would be greatly appreciated.
